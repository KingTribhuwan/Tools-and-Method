# Tools-and-Method
GitHub is a Web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. GitHub is free to use for public projects and  private repositories.

The tool gives a possibility to ask for a “pull request”. The logics is desplayed in Figure 1. The feature gives a possibility to “ streamline the process of discussing, reviewing, and managing changes to code” ( github.info). After the discussion and corrections, one can compare the code and see the unique parts in the branched version ( Figure 3). As soon as the changes are submitted the file can be merged to a new version. It is also trackable by whom the request was pulled and who contributed to merging, the feature is called “commits”
